This is the Repo of my Spam Detection project. It contains the following:

- PowerPoint Deck used to present the problem and my results 
- MVP (Minimal Viable Product) as a proof of concept at the beginning stages of this project 
- A Post-Project Summary
- A folder of web_app related files to run the Flask App for Spam classification demo
- Python code in the 3 Jupyter Notebooks, which are pending cleaning and organizing
